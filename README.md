# Dao hack repo

> Deployed [here](https://dao-hack.vercel.app) (work in progress).

Folder structure is self explanatory.

I'm not yet sure if backend is necessary, maybe we can just use on chain data + ipfs.

The frontend is copied from my other project, feel free to delete bloat. For css I use tailwind.

All files named with `.page.js` under `frontend/pages` will be treated as pages.
All files named with `.api.js` under `frontend/pages/api` will be treated as stateless api endpoints (like aws lambda).

Remember to `npm install`.
